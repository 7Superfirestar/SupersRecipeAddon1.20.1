# Super's Recipe Mod
This mod adds a bunch of different recipes that should be in the base game but arent. This includes things like smelting rotten flesh for leather, wool to string, improved lead recipe, etc.

Current recipes:

- Smelt rotten flesh to Leather

- Wool to string

- Saddle from leather

- Iron, golden and diamond horse armor are now craftable


Tags are defined in resources/data/forge/tags/items if you want to make your mod compatible with this one (synthetic leather/wool, etc.)
